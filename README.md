# Ew202w_Sdk Android SDK is a software development toolkit launched by Sleepace, aiming to conduct fast development for Internet
of Things APP on the Android platform. The SDK encapsulates the communication process between the APP and the hardware, 
and provides functions such as device configuration, device control, and data query. Using this SDK, 
users do not need to care about complex communication protocol and the underlying implementation,
only need to focus on APP interactions and business levels.
